This repository contains Machine Learning practice projects that describe my learning process from data exploration, visualisation to building prediction models.

All the datasets are public data downloaded from Kaggle.com. Feel free to use the download the data here for practice purposes.

The first project uses Titanic Survival data from https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data.
Focus:EDA, followed by building predicting models on the survival rate using scikit learn library.


The second project uses Climate Change: Earth Surface Temperature Data from https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data/notebooks
Focus: EDA, data visualization
Charts: Choropleth with slider, wodcloud based on frequencies
Findings: Temperature has been rising since 1750 and change happens most rapidly at the beginning in European countries. During WWII,temperature rises most in Europe and Japan. In the late 2000s,Asia region has the most increment in temperature.
