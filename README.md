# Data Science
This repository contains Machine Learning practice projects that describe my learning process from data exploration, visualisation to building prediction models.

All the datasets are public data downloaded from Kaggle.com. Feel free to use the download the data here for practice purposes.

The first project uses Titanic Survival data from https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data.
Focus:EDA, followed by building predicting models on the survival rate using scikit learn library.


The second project uses Climate Change: Earth Surface Temperature Data from https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data/notebooks
Focus: EDA, data visualization
Charts: Choropleth with slider, wordcloud based on frequencies, linecharts
Findings: Temperature has been rising since 1750 and rises most rapidly around 1822 to 1880s. This rise can be associated with the beginning of the industrial revolution in Europe.
