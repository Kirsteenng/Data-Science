This repository Ccntains Machine Learning practice projects that describe my learning process from data exploration, visualisation to building prediction models.

All the datasets are public data downloaded from Kaggle.com. Feel free to use the download the data here for practice purposes.

The first project uses Titanic Survival data from https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data.
This project mainly focuses on data exploration and visualisation, followed by building predicting models using scikit learn library.
